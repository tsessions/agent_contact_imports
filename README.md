# agent_contact_imports
A Python program that takes a large sample of home sales and exports them into a unique spreadsheet for each buyer's agent

This is a Python program that uses Pandas to create a client spreadsheet for every buyers agent that had a transaction in the input spreadsheet. I downloaded a large dataset of homes that sold over the past few years in Litchfield County and developed an algorithm to separate these transactions by the buyer's agent so that they can keep in touch with their clients. I did not choose the list agent, because the list agent is helping the client sell their home, and there is not data on where the client is moving. On the buyside, however, we have the client's name, property address, and mailing address. I used a for loop to find the unique values for the name of the buyer's agent and employed sorting, duplicate removal, and column reindexing to turn this batch of spreadsheets into a useful tool for each agent that received one. The final result is a unique spreadsheet for each buyside agent containing all of their transactions over a given time period with their client's information. This helps the agents keep intouch with their clients and continue to develop leads as they build their businesses. These were sent to the agents when the project was complete.
